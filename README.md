# Burp Suite Web Application Testing

## Objective

The Burp Suite web application testing project focused on enhancing web application security skills by utilizing Burp Suite, a leading integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. The primary objective was to identify vulnerabilities within web applications through practical exercises, improving skills in penetration testing and web security assessments.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using Burp Suite for web application security testing.
- Understanding of common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Ability to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses for security analysis.
- Enhanced knowledge of web application architecture and security principles.
- Development of systematic testing methodologies for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

- Burp Suite Professional for conducting security assessments and automated scans.
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox) with relevant extensions for enhanced testing capabilities.
- OWASP ZAP for comparative analysis of web application vulnerabilities.

## Steps

### 1. Setup Burp Suite

- Configured Burp Suite as a proxy to capture HTTP/S traffic from the browser.
